#KeysMe ðŸ˜˜

KeysMe is a tiny-tiny (note the double-tiny which makes it tiny * .5) 
library to handle keyboard interaction and super-complex hotkeys in a line.

It has ZERO dependencies and 100% test coverage by design.

Exported as a ES module, can work with any JS project + 
has a beautiful React hook for more enjoyment.
